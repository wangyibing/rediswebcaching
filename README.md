This project provides an implementation of a custom web caching mechanism using Redis key-value store.



### Introduction

To install, you'll need Git, Java (>= 7), and Maven. Once those are installed and setup, you can download the code using Git:

    git clone TODO

To start the jetty server with caching mechanism enabled on all /cached/* HTTP Get requests, type:

    mvn compile jetty:run

The jetty server will run on port 99999.
